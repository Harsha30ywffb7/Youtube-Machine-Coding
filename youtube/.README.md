# search bar 

# Debouncing:
    - lower the keystrokes diff - then user needs the suggestions.
    - Higher the keystrokes we need not to provide the suggestion with api calls for every keystroke.
    - that decreases the performance. 
    - Using debounce we can decrease the API calls.
    - example : search bars of flipkart, youtube, amazon. 
    - based on keystroke they show products by api call.

    * It gives high performance difference. 
    * websites need to show those suggestions for user ux, but need to slow those.

    # debouncing 200ms.
    -   if time diff between two strokes is 200ms no api calls.
    -   > 200ms then api call. 

# create a cache memory to use already searched keys even after backspace and delete keys.
    - using redux create a cache.
    - store search results in hashmap or store in a object the for the sake of good ds optimisation.

    - Best way by using LRU cache.
